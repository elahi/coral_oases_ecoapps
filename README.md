## Overview of folders in this repository

### analyse_oases_global

  - R scripts to assign reef oases, explore the data, run the hierarchical occupancy model, extract output from the model, make figures and tables
  
  - analysis figs: figures (those with FIG preceding the file name appear in the main body of the manuscript)
    
  - analysis_output: summary tables of analyses
  
  - map_cell_probs: maps of oasis occurrence probabilities for Florida (Figure 6)
  
  - covariates_subjurisdiction: plots of covariates at the subjurisdictional scale
  
  - map_covariates: example maps of covariates
  
  - model output
    - model_summaries: summaries of MCMC iterations
    - plot_diagnostics: posterior predictive plots
    - plot_trace: MCMC trace plots
    
  - model_rds: JAGS output, saved as RDS file
  
  - models: hierarchical occupancy model, written for JAGS

### data_output

  - df_samples.csv: summary table of sample sizes associated with each spatial scale

### ignore_folder (ignored on github due to large size)

### powell2_supplement

 - Appendix S2 includes the details of the hierarchical occupancy model
 
### R

  - accessory R scripts 
  
### workspace

  - data (and metadata) necessary to recreate all of the analyses and figures in the manuscript
