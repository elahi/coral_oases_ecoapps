### 1_process_msec

  - R scripts to process MSEC data from Yeager et al. 
  
### 1_process_noaa

  - R scripts to process NOAA data received from collaborators (Viehman, Williams)
  
### 2_compile_data

  - R scripts to compile all datasets
  
### 3_adjust_regions_2021  

  - R scripts to adjust categorical designations of regions
  
### 3_prep_global_data_2021

  - R scripts to prepare data for global analysis used for manuscript submitted to Ecological Applications
  
### analyse_oases_global

  - R scripts to assign reef oases, explore the data, run the hierarchical occupancy model, extract output from the model, make figures and tables
  
  - analysis figs: figures (those with FIG preceding the file name appear in the main body of the manuscript)
    
  - analysis_output: summary tables of analyses
  
  - map_cell_probs: maps of oasis occurrence probabilities for Florida (Figure 6)
