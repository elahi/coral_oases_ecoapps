Any use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.

Each pdf file contains a map of the predicted probability of oasis occurrence for each subregion. Each file is named according to the convention:

"REGION_Sub-region_grid_ypred_oases.pdf"

Each figure contains 4 panels, each corresponding to the spatial extent at which oases were defined. The code to create these maps is provided in the R script "07_map_ypred_probs_subregion.R". All the data and code to recreate the analyses and figures is provided in the zipped file "coral_oases_ecoapps.zip". 

For more details, please see the manuscript.
